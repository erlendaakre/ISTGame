ISTGame
=======
A simple game based on the IST cognitive test (Information Sampling Task), which is a test for impulsivity and decision making.
In the traditional test a 5x5 array of grey boxes is presented on screen, and the subject clicks each box to reveal one of two colours
hidden under the box. The amount of score possible is decreased for each box that is opened, and at any point the subject may guess the
colour and receive the points if correct, or loose points if incorrect.

The game allows two players (including computer opponent) to take turns playing, and in each turn the user may either open a box to reveal
a colour or guess which color is dominant  on the board.

The game is written in Java and uses a simple genetic algorithm to evolve computer opponents.
