The amount of score possible is decreased for each box that is opened, and at any point the subject may guess the\r\ncolour and receive the points if correct, or loose points if incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe game allows two players (including computer opponent) to take turns playing, and in each turn the user may either open a box to reveal\r\na colour or guess which color is dominant  on the board.\r\n\r\nThe game is written in Java and uses a simple genetic algorithm to evolve computer opponents.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n==========\r\nClark, L., Robbins, T.
